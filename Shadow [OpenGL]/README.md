# Graphic scene with OpenGL
========================

ABOUT
----------- 

I used a guide from NeHe to render shadows. The code for rendering shadows is 
also owned by NeHe.

Painted sphere and board. Board casts light on the scope and on the surface in the form of a 
laptop. Scope rendered by standard means. Board and surface means sessions has dropped 
shadow texture.

All objects in the scene rotate.
