# Graphic scene with OpenGL
========================

ABOUT
-----------

Drawn NURBS curved surface (hand painted).

Objects are generated using opengl lists. They also have a texture, and 
each child object are its shape.

Besides all this there is the opportunity to create room composed 
of squares, each of which has an original texture.

On scene you have multiple light sources. The scene was created for fun 
and to explore opportunities for opengl.

You can turn on the transparency of objects, as well as fog (but he is not a fog).
